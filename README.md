# CondensateAnalysis

CondensateAnalysis contains new functions that were developed for Ditlev, Vega, Koster et al., A composition-dependent molecular clutch between T cell signaling condensates and actin (https://www.biorxiv.org/node/97022.full), or functions employed in this work but not previously published.
